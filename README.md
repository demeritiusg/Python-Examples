## Python Excel Dashboard Generator
### Purpose:
Generates unique heatmap like dashboards based on dataset. 
### Libraries used:
* pandas
* sys
* os
* string
* shutil
* time
* dateutil
* datetime
* openpyxl
### How it works:
Dataset is imported using pandas and a list is created using the username column. That list is then iterated over creating the dashboards and organizing them in folders in alphabetical order. Openpyxl is used to add formatting (colors, alignment, etc).
